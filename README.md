# a-table-for-you üçΩÔ∏è (PHP Practice in Progress)

**Private Chef Website: Where the PHP is Always Fresh (and the CSS... well, it's getting there)**

Welcome to my culinary PHP adventure! This is a multi-page site I'm proofing my skills for a private chef (get it?). Think of it like a tasting menu ‚Äì each page is a little experiment, and some are tastier than others.

**Current Menu (Features):**

- **Navigation Bar:** A delightful dance between PHP's `basename` and some conditional formatting. It knows which page you're on (like a good waiter).
- **Grid Playtime:** I'm experimenting with CSS Grids. They need more seasoning.
- **Modular CSS Dreams:** I'm trying to organise my CSS like a well-stocked pantry. So far, it's more like a cupboard of doom. üí£

**Warning: Kitchen Hazard Zone!**

Proceed with caution ‚Äì this code is a work in progress. You might encounter:

- **CSS Mayhem:** Brace yourself for style mishaps. It's like my own cooking: I it just about tastes ok.
- **PHP Quirks:** There might be some unconventional PHP choices. Think of it as a fusion cuisine experiment.

**To Serve Locally (with XAMPP):**

1.  **Clone:** Grab this repository like it's the last slice of pizza.
2.  **XAMPP Setup:** Make sure you have XAMPP up and running (like a preheated oven).
3.  **htdocs:** Place this project in your XAMPP `htdocs` folder.
4.  **Fire it up:** Launch your browser and visit `http://localhost/a-table-for-you`

**Feedback Welcome!**

If you try this out, let me know what you think! Your feedback is like constructive criticism from Gordon Ramsay ‚Äì a little scary, but ultimately helpful.
