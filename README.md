**Private Chef Website: Where the PHP is Always Fresh (and the CSS... well, it's getting there)**

Welcome to my culinary PHP adventure! This is a multi-page site I'm proofing my skills for a private chef. Think of it like a tasting menu ‚Äì each page is a little experiment, and some are tastier than others.

## Chef's Special:

- **Navigation Bar:** A delightful dance between PHP's `basename` and some conditional formatting. It knows which page you're on (like a good waiter).

- **PHP Quirks:** There might be some unconventional PHP choices. Think of it as a fusion cuisine experiment while I'm learning.

## To Serve Locally (with XAMPP):

1.  **Clone:** Grab this repository like it's the last slice of pizza.
2.  **XAMPP Setup:** Make sure you have XAMPP up and running (like a preheated oven).
3.  **htdocs:** Place this project in your XAMPP `htdocs` folder.
4.  **Fire it up:** Launch your browser and visit `http://localhost/a-table-for-you/index.php`

## Future enhancements

- Integrate a contact form for seamless client communication
- Multilingual support (Spanish, French, Arabic) to cater to a diverse clientele.

## Feedback Welcome!

If you try this out, let me know what you think! Your feedback is like constructive criticism from Gordon Ramsay ‚Äì a little scary, but ultimately helpful.
